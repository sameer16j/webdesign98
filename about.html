					<p>
					Our journey began from a small shop in the  city of Thane in Maharashtra. The sheer quality and 
					the taste of the exotic spice blends developed soon became a favourite with the masses and
					necessitated the formation of a dedicated manufacturing unit to fulfill the market demand.
					It became the stepping stone of the renowned brand of spices – SAMRAT PICKLES.
                    Gradually the demand and popularity of SAMRAT PICKLES started spreading to other 
					cities of Maharashtra. With continual expansion a public limited company was established in 1994
					with the name of “SAMRAT Pickles & Foods Limited”. Quality and innovation are the pillars of our
					success in the pursuit of culinary ecstasy.These are loved by the masses for the taste, variants and 
					convenience that they bring.
